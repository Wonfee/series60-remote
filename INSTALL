 - Mobile phone
          - Operating system: S60 3rd Edition
              ( Here is a list of devices: http://series60-remote.sourceforge.net/index.php?module=Content&func=view&pid=8 )
          - PyS60 (will be installed when you run the wizard)


OPTIONAL PACKAGES
-----------------

 - PC
           - PyOBEX or Obexftp (for sending *.sis files to the phone, File Browser)
           - Matplotlib (for generating statistics)


INSTALLATION
------------

Windows: There is also a binary package available, please use this for an easy installation.
Fedora Linux: There is also a RPM package available, please use this for an easy installation.

Linux:
Please install all requirements first, for example use this command in Fedora:
# su -c 'yum install python PyQt4 pybluez python-obexftp python-matplotlib'

Ubuntu needs the following packages:
# sudo aptitude install python python-obexftp python-matplotlib python-bluez python-qt4 python-qt4-sql sqlite3 libqt4-sql-sqlite

You can test the application before you install it:
# cd pc
# ./series60_remote.py

If you want to install the application just run
# ./setup.py install
in your root directory.

This will create the folders /usr/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/series60_remote
and /usr/share/series60-remote and a wrapper script in /usr/bin/series60-remote
on Linux.

If you want to change these folders you have to use the --prefix argument (for
example: ./setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local )


SPECIAL NOTES FOR USERS OF THE SVN VERSION
-------------------------------------------

You have to run
# cd pc
# ./mkpyqt.py
first.

If you're on Linux please run
# cd mobile
# ./create_package
# cd ..
# cd pc
# ./generate-pro.sh
too.


----------------------------------------------
THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS ARE ONLY FOR DEVELOPERS
----------------------------------------------


CREATE A SOURCE DISTRIBUTION
----------------------------

If you want to create a source archive (tar.gz) you have to run:
# ./setup.py sdist

This will create the file series60-remote-X.Y.tar.gz in the dist/ folder.


CREATE A BINARY DISTRIBUTION
----------------------------

If you want to create a RPM file for many Linux distributions use the spec
file in pc/install/rpm:
# cd pc/install/rpm
# rpmbuild -ba series60-remote.spec

You can also create an executable file for MS Windows (you have to run the following
commands under windows):
At first you have to install PyInstaller and Inno Setup

# cd pc/install/win32
# C:\PythonX.Y\python.exe \path\to\pyinstaller\Build.py series60-remote.spec

| Note: You can also create a simple wrapper script in your path with the following content:
| C:\PythonX.Y\python.exe "path\\to\\pyinstaller\Build.py" %1%
| If you named it Build.bat you can call if afterwards with
| # Build.bat series60-remote.spec
| ( Much simpler, isn't it? ;) )

This will create the directory dist/ with the executable series60-remote.exe.
Please test this file before you proceed.

Now we can build an installer with Inno Setup:
Just open the series60-remote.iss file with your Inno Setup Compiler
and click on Build - Compile.

This will create series60-remote-X.Y.exe in the Output directory.
