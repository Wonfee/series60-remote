- Do NOT use New-style Signal and Slot Support
   Use self.connect(self.movie, SIGNAL("frameChanged(int)"),  SIGNAL("needsRedraw()"))
   instead of self.movie.frameChanged.connect(self.needsRedraw)
   
   We need to support the latest binary release of PyQt4 for Python 2.5 and Windows
   and this release version is 4.4.3, which doesn't support new-style signals and slots.
   
   We can use new-style signals and slots when there is a new release of PyQt4 for Python 2.5
   or pyinstaller support Python 2.6 (so we can drop Python 2.5 support).
